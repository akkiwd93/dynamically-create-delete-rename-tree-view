# dynamically-create-delete-rename-tree-view
Our goal is to create a category tree, with infinite depth.  Something like this:  Your solution should include next features:  ● Ability to add new subcategories for each category.  ● Rename category.  ● Delete category (if it has children - delete them as well).  ● Expand/Collapse parent category (children's categories should collapse too).
